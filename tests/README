NOTE
----
All the *.Rout-N-save files have been renamed from
        *.Rout.save
because the result of these examples depend *very* much
on the exact platform (compiler/machine) used -- unfortunately :

R CMD check cobs
gave too many differences (April 2002), dependent on the platform
used.  I have seen big differences on the same Linux
architecture, just from using different version of gcc (2.96 <-> 3.0.1)
The current ./tests/*.Rout.save  files were produced on an oldish "robust"
Solaris compiler set.
