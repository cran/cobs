				-*- org -*- for Emacs: use 'Org' menu and [Tab] key
* NOTE:  *.Rout.save  +- ok
** Cobs version 1.2-2, CRAN Date: 2011-04-25: they *.Rout.save are there and +- ok
** Goal: Still get rid of several *.Rout.save  and use  all.equal() etc
** [[0_pt-ex.R]] : first file with sessionInfo() etc:
 packageVersions of SparseM, quantreg, cobs and *no* .Rout.save file of course
* Old Note (Apr 28, 2002):  Platform dependence
  --------
All the *.Rout-N-save files have been renamed from
        *.Rout.save
because the result of these examples depend *very* much
on the exact platform (compiler/machine) used -- unfortunately :

R CMD check cobs
gave too many differences (April 2002), dependent on the platform
used.  I have seen big differences on the same Linux
architecture, just from using different version of gcc (2.96 <-> 3.0.1)
The current ./tests/*.Rout.save  files were produced on an oldish "robust"
Solaris compiler set.
