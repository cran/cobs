- Documentation (and examples!) for the intermediate/ auxiliary functions
  qsbks() and drqssbcs(), i.e.  man/qbsks.Rd & man/drqssbc.Rd

- need examples with degree = 1
  and several other values of tau
  also extreme cases of interpolation and global linear/quadratic

- src/splines.c is UN-needed in R --- rather use library(splines) !!
  ------------- now have .Call(*) there instead of .C() here.

   partly done: now use .splBasis() and .splValue() <<<<-- R/splines.R -->
   --> tests/spline-ex.R  shows how .splBasis() can be done via library(splines)


- src/drqssbc.f (originally ratfor): has its own RNG  dunif01() !!
  ------------- this ensures 100% portability, but...

- lambda < 0; for each pp.lambda, instead of (only) $sic,
  return both components : Log.lik. and p[lambda] ( = k[lambda] ), the dim.

-----------------------------

Old `TODOs' which are done (here for reference only):
==========            ====

- add the three interesting real data examples from the COBS "paper".
  in the paper, they say that S-plus code for these examples is available
  as well. --> see also ./inst/scripts/ and ./tests/

- example(cobs) gives lots of warnings;
  the upper and lower quantiles are not plotted (not properly computed ??)

- man/cobs.Rd  needs the current reference list !

- cobs() should keep its call and return an object of class "cobs".

  Then print.cobs(), summary.cobs(), predict.cobs() and plot.cobs() should
  be designed!
	---> this is now done  { --> old & original code in ./R/cobsOld.R }
